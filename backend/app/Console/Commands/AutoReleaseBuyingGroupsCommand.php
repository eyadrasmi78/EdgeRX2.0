/**
 * Sweeps buying_groups whose window_ends_at has passed and either
 *   - releases them (threshold met → orders created)
 *   - dissolves them (threshold not met → notify + close)
 *
 * BE-27 wording fix: this command is "safe to re-run", not strictly idempotent.
 * Terminal groups are skipped, and BuyingGroupReleaseService::release uses
 * lockForUpdate() so two parallel invocations cannot produce duplicate orders.
 * The 10-minute `withoutOverlapping` mutex on the hourly schedule means the
 * concurrent-execution path is unreachable in normal operation; the row-level
 * lock is the actual correctness guarantee.
